# Demonstration Code

Example code used in this presentation is included within this directory. Each sub-directory contains the sample code and instructions for running that demonstration. 

- **Hello World** - Introductory examples creating OpenWhisk Actions for Node.js and Java.
- **Weather Bot** - Sample microservices used to build the *Weather Bot* application using OpenWhisk.
- **Bitcoin API** - Create HTTP APIs for OpenWhisk Actions using Web Actions or API Gateway.

*Developers need to register with an OpenWhisk platform to deploy these examples, see instructions below for IBM Bluemix.*

## OpenWhisk on IBM Bluemix

These steps explain how to provision a new OpenWhisk service on IBM's cloud platform. Developers need to register for an account and setup the command-line utility to interact with OpenWhisk. 

## Register for an account with IBM Bluemix

- Browse to https://console.ng.bluemix.net/ and click _Sign Up_

- Fill out the registration form details to create a new account.

- Open the link emailed by IBM Bluemix to confirm your account.

- Log into IBM Bluemix using your new credentials.

## Setting up your account

- During this initial logon, developers are asked to set up _organisation_ and _space_ identifiers for their region.
- Ensure the Region dropdown is set to _US-South_ not _London_ or _Sydney_.
- Use your account email address as the organisation identifier.
- Use _dev_ as the space identifier.
- Click _I'm Ready_ to finalise environment setup.

## OpenWhisk on IBM Bluemix

_Note: You can skip the following steps and visit the [CLI setup link](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/cli) directly without having to manually find it._

Once you've logged into the platform and finished setting up your account, follow these steps to provision an instance. 

- Click the "[Try the new Bluemix](https://new-console.eu-gb.bluemix.net/)" link in the home page.

- In the new catalogue page, scroll down the bottom to access the "[Bluemix Experimental Services](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/labs/)" link. 

- Select [OpenWhisk](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk) from the _Compute_ section.

- Select the [Use The CLI](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/cli) link at the bottom of the page.

## Setting up OpenWhisk CLI

- Follow the steps on the CLI setup page. This includes downloading and installing the command-line utility and authenticating with your user credentials. 

- You can verify everyting is correctly configured by invoking this sample Action using the CLI.

  ```
  wsk action invoke /whisk.system/samples/echo -p message hello --blocking --result
  ```


**All good? Great, you're ready to deploy those demosâ€¦**
